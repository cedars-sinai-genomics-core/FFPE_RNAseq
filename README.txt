The QuantSeq Data Analysis Pipelines (Bluebee Genomics Platform) are available for a
range of species and are adapted specifically for the analysis of QuantSeq 3' mRNA-seq 
data.

1. Connect and Upload Your Data
Zipped individual FASTQ files (up to 1.5 GB per file) are the required input for QuantSeq 
Data Analysis Pipelines. Uploading and downloading data is handled by the Bluebee® Service 
Connector.

2. Run Your Pipeline
There are various pipeline options to then select to analyze your data:
  • QuantSeq FWD and REV Data Analysis Pipelines for multiple species.
  • QuantSeq FWD-UMI Data Analysis Pipeline (FWD-UMI) for multiple species.
  
3. Retrieve Your Results
Select the Runs option in the Project to view the status of your runs. To view and 
download the data, select the Data option

4. Upload results to Titan and use Automation system to generate combined Count file 
and MultiQC report
