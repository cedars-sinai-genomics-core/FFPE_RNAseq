The QuantSeq Data Analysis Pipelines (Bluebee® Genomics Platform) are available for a range of species and are adapted specifically for the analysis of QuantSeq 3' 
mRNA-seq data.

1. Connect and Upload Your Data
Zipped individual FASTQ files (up to 1.5 GB per file) are the required input for 
QuantSeq Data Analysis Pipelines. Uploading and downloading data is handled by the 
Bluebee® Service Connector.

2. Run Your Pipeline
There are various pipeline options to use and then select to analyze your data:
  • QuantSeq FWD and REV Data Analysis Pipelines for multiple species.
  • QuantSeq FWD-UMI Data Analysis Pipeline (FWD-UMI) for multiple species.
  
3. Retrieve Your Results
Select the Runs option in the Project to view the status of your runs. To view and 
download the data, click output files for each sample and download read_distribution.txt, 
read_counts.txt, and fastqc_files.tar.gz for each sample. 

4. Creating a folder called "results" in the corresponding project folder and upload
the results of each sample generated by the pipeline to the folder. Note that the three
files (read_distribution.txt, read_counts.txt, and fastqc_files.tar.gz for each sample 
need to be in the same folder for each sample. Next, copy FFPE_mRNA_multiqc_report_generation.sh 
and FFPE_mRNA_count_matrix_generation.sh folder to the project folder (outside of results 
folder). Then run FFPE_mRNA_multiqc_report_generation.sh followed
by FFPE_mRNA_count_matrix_generation.sh to generate multiqc report and the count file. 
(The two bash files are in /common/genomics-core/bin). 

Note: Mapping QC will be added later to the Github page. 
Contact support@lexogen.com if the size of a FASTQ file is bigger than 1.5 GB and they will give corresponding activation code.
